  <title>Installing PHPUnit</title>

  <para>
    PHPUnit should be installed using the
    <ulink url="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR Installer</ulink>. This installer is
    the backbone of PEAR, which provides a distribution system for PHP packages,
    and is shipped with every release of PHP since version 4.3.0.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      PHPUnit 3.6 requires PHP 5.2.7 (or later) but PHP 5.3.3 (or later) is
      highly recommended.
    </para>

    <para>
      PHP_CodeCoverage, the library that is used by PHPUnit 3.6 to collect and
      process code coverage information, depends on Xdebug 2.0.5 (or later) but
      Xdebug 2.1.0 (or later) is highly recommended.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    The PEAR channel (<systemitem role="URL">pear.phpunit.de</systemitem>) that
    is used to distribute PHPUnit needs to be registered with the local PEAR
    environment. Furthermore, a component that PHPUnit depends upon is hosted on
    the Symfony Components PEAR channel (<systemitem role="URL">pear.symfony-project.com</systemitem>).

  <para>
    This has to be done only once. Now the PEAR Installer can be used to
    install packages from the PHPUnit channel:
  </para>

  <screen><userinput>pear install phpunit/PHPUnit</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    After the installation you can find the PHPUnit source files inside your
    local PEAR directory; the path is usually
    <filename>/usr/lib/php/PHPUnit</filename>.
