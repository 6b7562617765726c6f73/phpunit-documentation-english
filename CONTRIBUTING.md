## Contributor Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a 
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this 
project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Workflow

* Fork the project
* Make your changes
* Run `make html` to make sure that the documentation can be built and looks as expected
* Send a pull request against the oldest branch of the documentation to which your changes are relevant

Please target the oldest branch affected in case your pull request fixes a bug or typo.

Please make sure that you have 
[set up your user name and email address](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) 
for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` look really 
stupid in the commit history of a project.

Due to time constraints, we are not always able to respond as quickly as we 
would like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to remind us if 
you feel that we forgot to respond.
