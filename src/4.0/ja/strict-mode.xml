    <title>Test Execution Timeout</title>

    <para>
      A time limit can be enforced for the execution of a test if the
      <literal>PHP_Invoker</literal> package is installed and the
      <literal>pcntl</literal> extension is available.
    </para>

    <para>
      A test annotated with <literal>@large</literal> will fail if it takes
      longer than 60 seconds to execute. This timeout is configurable via the
      <literal>timeoutForLargeTests</literal> attribute in the XML
      configuration file.
    </para>

    <para>
      A test annotated with <literal>@medium</literal> will fail if it takes
      longer than 10 seconds to execute. This timeout is configurable via the
      <literal>timeoutForMediumTests</literal> attribute in the XML
      configuration file.
    </para>

    <para>
      A test that is not annotated with <literal>@medium</literal> or
      <literal>@large</literal> will be treated as if it were annotated with
      <literal>@small</literal>. A small test will fail if it takes longer than
      1 second to execute. This timeout is configurable via the
      <literal>timeoutForSmallTests</literal> attribute in the XML configuration
      file.
